## Draft Title: Viewing NYC Nightlife in Transportation Lens
In a city known for its vibrant culture and bustling streets, the absence of nightlife in New York City poses a thought-provoking scenario. This thesis delves into the intricate web of interactions and connections that characterize the city's nocturnal landscape, exploring its significance for both residents and visitors alike. Nightlife isn't just about entertainment; it serves as a crucial arena for socialization, cultural expression, and the forging of identities, particularly for the city's youth. Moreover, for tourists, it offers a unique opportunity to immerse themselves in the essence of New York City. Through visual comparisons between day, night, and a hypothetical scenario devoid of nightlife, this thesis aims to illuminate the profound impact of nocturnal activities on the city's fabric. By examining the gradual dispersion of clusters—both residential and tourist-oriented—in relation to nightlife hotspots, insights into the symbiotic relationship between these elements emerge. Furthermore, transportation emerges as a crucial facilitator, acting as the glue that binds together these disparate nodes of activity. Through visual representations, this thesis seeks to elucidate the role of transportation modes such as subways, citi bikes, and taxis in fostering connectivity, safety, convenience, and cost-effectiveness within the nocturnal landscape of New York City.
